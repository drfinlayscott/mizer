The mizer package implements multi-species size-based modelling in R. It has 
been designed for modelling marine ecosystems.

Using mizer is relatively simple.  There are three main stages: 

1. Setting the model parameters. This is done by creating an object of 
class \code{MizerParams}. This includes model parameters such as the life 
history parameters of each species, and the range of the size spectrum.

2. Running a simulation. This is done by calling the \code{project()} 
method on the model parameters. This produces an object of \code{MizerSim} 
which contains the results of the simulation.

3. Exploring results. After a simulation has been run, the results can be 
explored using a range of plots and summaries.
