The mizer package implements multi-species size-based modelling in R. It has 
been designed for modelling marine ecosystems.

Using mizer is relatively simple.  There are three main stages: 

1. Setting the model parameters. This is done by creating an object of 
class \code{MizerParams}. This includes model parameters such as the life 
history parameters of each species, and the range of the size spectrum.

2. Running a simulation. This is done by calling the \code{project()} 
method on the model parameters. This produces an object of \code{MizerSim} 
which contains the results of the simulation.

3. Exploring results. After a simulation has been run, the results can be 
explored using a range of plots and summaries. 

There is a [series of YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh0PDyTUssw&list=PLCTMeyjMKRkqR7uohI3p-61P7ZJj8sd5B) explaining how to use and install mizer.
Perhaps the easiest way for newcomers to get into using mizer is to access 
[the online app](https://mizer.shinyapps.io/selectivity/). However, to enjoy the 
full functionality of mizer we recommend the user installs it with R, as 
described below: 

## Installing mizer

mizer is a package for the R open-source statistical programming language. R is 
available from the CRAN website, which is also an excellent source of
documentation and tutorials.

The easiest way to install mizer (assuming you have an active internet
connection) is to start an session and then type:

```
install.packages("mizer")
```

After installing mizer, to actually use it you need to load the package using
the \code{library()} function. Note that whilst you only need to install the
package once, it will need to be loaded every time you start a new R session.

```
library(mizer)
```

The source code for mizer is hosted on
[Github.](https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer) If you are feeling brave and
wish to try out a development version of mizer you can install the package from
here using the R package devtools (which was used extensively in putting
together mizer).

## Getting help in R

As you probably know, to access documentation in R you can use the \code{help()}
function. This can be used to access package documentation in a range of ways.
For example:

```
help(package="mizer")
help(mizer)
help(project)
```

The first command gives a technical summary of the package, including the
available functions.
The second command gives a brief introduction to mizer.
The third gives the documentation page for the method \code{project()}.

Some methods are associated with several R classes. For example, the
\code{plot()} method is generic and can be used on a wide range of R objects.
The \code{plot()} method has been overloaded in mizer to plot MizerSim objects. 
To select the help page for the appropriate plotting method you can either just
use \code{help(plot)} and then select from a menu of packages or you can supply
the package name in the \code{help()} command:

```
help(plot, package="mizer")
```


There are other ways of accessing package documentation that you may not be
familiar with. To access the the help page of a particular method you can use:
\code{method ? method-name}. For example, to access the help page of the
\code{getFeedingLevel()} method you can use:

```
method ? getFeedingLevel
```

This also works for getting information on a class. For example, to get the help
page on the MizerParams class you can use:

```
class ? MizerParams
```


These two ways of getting help can be useful when a class and a method have the
same name. For example, MizerParams is a class and also the name of the method
for creating MizerParams objects.
