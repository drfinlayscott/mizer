# Introduction

This vignette is for you if you need to extend mizer 
to meet the needs of your research project.
You will already have read the [main mizer vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mizer/vignettes/mizer_vignette.pdf) and thus be
familiar with what mizer can do out of the box.
You now want to implement the extension or modification of the
model required for your research, and for that you need to dive into 
the internal workings of mizer. This vignette is meant to make
that as easy as possible.

The first thing you should do, even before reading this vignette, is to
go to https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer/issues and create a new "issue""
to share your ideas and plans with the mizer community. You may get back 
valuable feedback and advice.

# Preparation
In this section we describe how to set up your working environment
to allow you to easily work with the mizer code. Much of it you
may already have in place, so feel free to skip ahead.

## Installing R, RStudio

Mizer is compatible with R versions 3.1 and later.
If you still need to [install R](https://www.r-project.org/), simply install 
the latest version. 

This guide assumes that you will be using RStudio to work with R. There is
really no reason not to use RStudio and it makes a lot of things much easier.
RStudio develops rapidly and adds useful features all the time and so it pays 
to upgrade to the [latest version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) 
frequently. This guide was written with version 1.2.830.
version 

## Forking mizer from github

Go to https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer and fork it into your own repository. Then create a version control new project in Rstudio, and indicate your depository url. 

### Installing git

### Using git inside RStudio

## Working with an R package

# Implementation of the model

In this section we will revisit the presentation of the mizer model given
in chapter 3 of the main [mizer vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mizer/vignettes/mizer_vignette.pdf)
but with more detail of how this model is implemented in code. We will still
stay a bit at the surface, delaying a detailed look at how the code is
organised until the section [Finding your way around the mizer code].

## The size spectrum
The model framework builds on two central assumption and a number of lesser 
standard assumption.  

The first central assumption is that an individual can be characterized by its 
weight $w$ and its species number $i$ only. The aim of the model is to calculate 
the size spectrum ${\cal N}_i(w)$, which is the *density* of individuals of
species $i$ such that ${\cal N}_i(w)dw$ is the *number* of individuals of
species $i$ in the size interval $[w:w+dw]$. 

To represent this continuous size spectrum in the computer, the size
variable $w$ is discretized into a vector of weights `w` of
length `no_w`. These weights are logarithmically spaced, so that
`w[j]=w[1]*exp(j*dx)` for some `dx`.

In the code the size spectrum is stored as an array such that `n[i, j]`
holds the density ${\cal N}_i(w_j,t_k)$ at weights $w_j=$`w[j]`. 
Note that contrary to what one might have expected,
`n[i, j]` is not the *number* of individuals but the *density*.
The number of individuals in size bin $j$ is given by  `n[i, j]*dw[j]`.

The time evolution of the size spectrum is described by the 
McKendrik-von Foerster equation, which is simply a conservation equation:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:MvF}
  \frac{\partial N_i(w)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial g_i(w) N_i(w)}{\partial w} 
  = -\mu_i(w) N_i(w)
\end{equation}

where individual growth $g_i(w)$ and mortality $\mu_i(w)$ will be described
below. 

This differential equation is approximated in mizer by a
finite-difference approximation (to be described in section ...). This
allows the `project()` method in mizer to project the size spectrum 
forwards in time: Given the spectrum at one time the `project()` method
calculates it at a set of later times.

Besides the fish spectrum there is also a resource spectrum
${\cal N}_R(w_j)=$`n_pp[j]` representing for example the phytoplankton.

## Predator-prey preference
The second central assumption is that the preference of a predator for
prey depends on the size of the prey **only** through the predator/prey
size ratio. Thus the preference of
an individual of species $i$ and weight $w$ for prey of species $j$ and
weight $w_p$ is assumed to factorize as $\theta_{ij}\phi(w_p/w)$ into
a species preference matrix $\theta_{ij}$ and a weight selection function
$\phi(w_p/w)$. 

The species preference matrix $\theta_{ij}$, also referred to as the
apecies interaction matrix, is stored in `interaction[i,j]`. It is currently
assumed to be weight independent.

The choice of the function $\phi_i(w_p/w)$ is not central. It is currently
hard-coded to the truncated log-normal function

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:4}
  \phi_i(w_p/w) = \begin{cases}
  \exp \left[ \frac{-(\ln(w/(w_p \beta_i)))^2}{2\sigma_i^2} \right]
  &\text{ if }w/w_p\in\left[0,\beta_i\exp(3\sigma_i)\right]\\
  0&\text{ otherwise,}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\beta_i$ is the preferred predator-prey mass ratio and $\sigma_i$ the 
width of the weight selection function.


## Available energy

The available food (mass per volume) for a predator of weight $w$ is determined 
by integrating over all species and the resource spectrum weighted by the 
size selection function: 

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  E_{a.i}(w) = \int \left( N_R(w_p) + \sum_{j} \theta_{ij} N_j(w_p) \right) 
  \phi_i(w_p/w) w_p \, dw_p.
\end{equation}

This available energy is calculated by the `getAvailEnergy()` method.
The integral is approximated by a Riemann sum over all weight brackets.
\[
\text{avail_energy}[i,j] = \sum_{k=1}^{\text{no_w}}
\left( n_{pp}[k] + \sum_{j} \theta[i,j] n[i,k] \right) 
  \phi_i\left(w[k]/w[j]\right) w[k] dw[k].
\]
The convolution theorem together with the Fast Fourier Transform is then used 
to efficiently evaluate this for all $w_j$.

## Consumption

The food actually encountered $E_{e.i}$ (mass per time) depends on the search 
volume rate (volume per time):

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Ee}
  E_{e.i}(w) = \text{search_vol}_i(w) E_{a.i}(w).
\end{equation}

The encountered food is consumed subjected to a standard Holling functional 
response type II to represent satiation. This determines the 
*feeding level* $f_i(w)$, which is a dimensionless number between 0 
(no food) and 1 (fully satiated) so that $1-f_i(w)$ is the proportion of the
encountered food that is consumed. It is given by

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:f}
  f_i(w) = \frac{E_{e.i}(w)}{E_{e.i}(w) + \text{intake_max}_i(w)},
\end{equation}

where `intake_max` is the maximum consumption rate.

The feeding level is calculated with the method `getFeedingLevel()`.

The rate at which food is
consumed is then $(1-f_i(w))E_{e.i}(w)=f_i(w) \text{intake_max}_i(w)$.


## Growth

The consumed food is assimilated with an efficiency $\alpha$ and 
used to fuel the needs for metabolism and 
activity and movement. The remaining rate, if any,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Er}
  E_{r.i}(w) = \max(0, \alpha f_i(w) h_i w^n - \text{metab_i(w)})
\end{equation}
is used for growth and reproduction. This is calculated with the 
`getEReproAndGrowth()` method.

When food supply does not cover the requirements of metabolism and activity, 
growth and reproduction stops, i.e. there is no negative growth.
The individual should then be subjected to a starvation mortality, but starvation
mortality is not implemented in mizer at the moment.

The proportion of $E_{r.i}(w)$ that is used for reproduction is given by
a function $\psi_i(w)$ that changes between 
zero around the weight of maturation $w_{m.i}$ to one at the asymptotic weight 
$W_i$ where all available energy is used for reproduction. This function
$\psi$ is stored in an array `psi[i,j]`$=\psi(w_j)$.

Thus the somatic growth function is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:growth}
  g_i(w) = E_{r.i}(w)\left(1-\psi_i(w)\right).
\end{equation}
It is calculated by the `getEGrowth()` method.
