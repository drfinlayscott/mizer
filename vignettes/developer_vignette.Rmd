# Introduction

This vignette is for you if you need to extend mizer 
to meet the needs of your research project. 
You will already have read the mizer model description in
`vignette("model_description")`
and thus be familiar with what mizer can do out of the box.
You now want to implement the extension or modification of the
model required for your research, and for that you need to dive into 
the internal workings of mizer. This vignette is meant to make
that as easy as possible.

The first thing you should do, even before reading this vignette, is to
go to https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer/issues and create a new "issue""
to share your ideas and plans with the mizer community. You may get back 
valuable feedback and advice. Another way to get in touch with the
mizer community is via the [size-spectrum modelling Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/size-spectrum-models).


# Setting up working environment
In this section we describe how to set up your working environment
to allow you to easily work with the mizer code. Much of it you
may already have in place, so feel free to skip ahead.

## Installing R, RStudio and Git

Mizer is compatible with __R__ versions 3.1 and later.
If you still need to [install R](https://cran.r-project.org/), simply install 
the latest version. This vignette was prepared with
`r R.version.string`.

This guide assumes that you will be using __RStudio__ to work with R. There is
really no reason not to use RStudio and it makes a lot of things much easier.
RStudio develops rapidly and adds useful features all the time and so it pays 
to upgrade to the [latest version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) 
frequently. This guide was written with version 1.2.1268.

Mizer is developed using the version control system __Git__ and the code is hosted
on GitHub. To contribute to the mizer code, you need to have the Git software
installed on your system. On most Linux machines it will be installed already,
but on other platforms you need to
[install it](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html). You do not need to install
any GUI for git because RStudio has 
[built-in support for git](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN). 
A good place to learn about using Git and GitHub is 
[this chapter](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html) 
in the guide by Hadley on R package development.

## Forking mizer from GitHub

To work with the code you will create your own git repository with a copy of the mizer code. Go to https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer and fork it into your own repository by clicking the "Fork" button.

<center>
![](images/fork.png){width=80%}
</center>

You will be prompted to log in to GitHub. If you do not yet have an account, 
you need to create one for yourself.

Once you have your own fork of the mizer repository, you create a local copy on
whichever machine you work on. You can do this from within RStudio. For this you
click on the "Project" drop-down and then select "New Project...".

<center>
![](images/new_project.png){width=80%}
</center>

This will bring up a dialog box where you select "Version Control".
<center>
![](images/version_control.png){width=50%}
</center>

Provided you have Git installed and RStudio was able to find it you can then
choose "Git" on the next dialog box.

<center>
![](images/git.png){width=50%}
</center>

If the Git option is not showing, the you need to troubleshoot, and perhaps
https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-see-git.html helps.

In the next dialog box you let RStudio know where to find your fork.
<center>
![](images/repository.png){width=50%}
</center>

To find the correct repository URL you go back to GitHub to the front page of 
the repository that was created when you forked the official mizer repository.
There you will find a "Clone or download" button which when clicked will
reveal the repository URL. Make sure that you are on the page of your fork of
the repository. The URL should contain your GitHub username.
<center>
![](images/repro_url.png){width=80%}
</center>

You can copy that to the clipboard by pressing the
button next to the URL and then paste it back into the RStudio dialog box.
In that dialog box you can also change where RStudio stores the repository on
your machine. Choose anywhere convenient. Then click "Create Project".


## Setting up RStudio developer tools

To work with R packages as a developer, you will need to
[install additional tools](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486498-Package-Development-Prerequisites). 

Once you have these tools in place, you should install the devtools and roxygen2 packages with
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2"))
```

You are now all set to develop R packages, and 
[RStudio makes this extra easy](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486488-Developing-Packages-with-RStudio). There is even a cheat sheet "Package Development with devtools" accessible from the Help menu in RStudio.

To set things up, click on Build -> More -> Configure Build Tools.

<center>
![](images/build_tools.png)
</center>

In the resulting dialog box, tick the checkboxes "Use devtools package functions if available" and "Generate documentation with roxygen" and then click on "Configure".

<center>
![](images/roxygen.png){width=50%}
</center>

This will open another dialog box where you tick "Install and Restart".

<center>
![](images/tick.png){width=40%}
</center>

Hit "OK". While you are on the Project Options dialog box, click on
"Code Editing" and then check "Insert spaces for tabs" and set "Tab width"
to 4, because that is the convention the mizer code follows.

<center>
![](images/tabs.png){width=50%}
</center>

## Installing mizer
You are now ready to install the mizer package using the development code from
GitHub. First you should do this with the command
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("sizespectrum/mizer")
```
This will automatically also install all the other packages that mizer depends
on. However this uses the version of the code in the official mizer repository
on GitHub, not your local copy of the code. Once you have made changes to your
local code, you will want to install mizer using that code. To do this 
go to the "Build" tab in RStudio and click on "Install and Restart" or
alternatively use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+B.
<center>
![](images/build.png)
</center>

You can watch the progress in the "Build" tab. Once the build has completed, you will see that in the console RStudio automatically runs
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(mizer)
```
to load you freshly built mizer package. 
You will want to click "Install and Restart" whenever you have changed your
local code.

# Working with git

You will be making your code changes in your fork of the mizer code (we are
using the so-called Fork & Pull model). From time to time you will want to
interact with the main mizer repository in two ways:

1. You will want to contribute some of your code back to the mizer project, so
that it benefits others and also so that it gets automatically included in
future releases.

2. You will want to be able to merge new developments made in mizer by others
into your code base.

This interaction is made possible with git and GitHub. 

It initially takes a bit
of effort to get the hang of how this works. Therefore here we will take you
through a little exercise that will see you create a feature branch, make a
change to a mizer file, commit that file and push it to GitHub, and then make a
pull request to contribute the change back to the core mizer code. The change
that you will be making consists of adding your name to the list of people who
have set up a fork of mizer.

We assume that you have checked out your mizer fork to your local computer
as described in the section [Forking mizer from GitHub](#forking-mizer-from-github).

## Creating a branch
At this point you will be on the "master" branch of your repository. The code
in this branch of your repository is a perfect copy of the code in the master
branch of the main mizer repository at https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer.
You should always keep it that way and not commit any changes to this branch.

You should do all our development work in branches that have been branched off
from the master branch. When you start working on a feature or on a bug fix, start a new branch with a
name suggestive of the feature or fix. In this example, where you will be adding
your info to the list of people who have set up a fork of mizer, let's call the
branch "add_my_info".

To create the new branch, first make sure you have selected the master branch
on the "Switch branch" dropdown in RStudio Git panel and then click the button
to the left of that dropdown.
<center>
![](images/new_branch_button.png){width=30%}
</center>

In the dialog box enter the name for your new branch: "add_my_info". Leave 
the remote as "origin" and make sure the "Sync branch with remote" checkbox is
ticked. This means that the new branch will be created not only on your local
repository but also on your GitHub repository. Click "Create". You are now on
a new branch in your repository, but so far this branch contains only exactly
the same content as the master branch that you have branched off from.

## Editing a file

Next you will make an edit to a file. In the "Files" tab in RStudio, navigate
to the "vignette" subdirectory and click on the name "developer_vignette.Rmd".
That will open that file in the Source editor pane. That file is the source
file for this developer guide, written in [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) format.

A good way to navigate within files is to use the document outline which will
be displayed when you hit the right-most icon on the editor pane toolbar.
<center>
![](images/outline.png){width=30%}
</center>

You will find the subheading "People with a mizer fork" towards the bottom of
the outline. Clicking on it will move to the corresponding section of the file.
You can now add another bullet point with your name and interests. 

This is an RMarkdown file, so you can compile it by clicking on the "Knit"
button on the editor toolbar. This will also save your changes to the disk.
After a short while the resulting html file will be displayed in an RStudio
viewer which will allow you to check the formatting of your bullet point.

If you had made changes to the actual R code of mizer, then you would of course
also rebuild mizer from that new code by clicking "Install and Restart" on
the "Build" pane of RStudio to test it, and would in particular run the
automated unit tests by hitting Ctrl+Shift+T.

## Commiting your changes

So far you have only saved your changes to your local disc, but have not yet
committed it to your local repository. To do that you click on the "Commit"
button on the toolbar in the "Git" pane in RStudio:
<center>
![](images/commit_button.png){width=40%}
</center>

This will pop up a screen like the following:
<center>
![](images/commit.png){width=70%}
</center>

The blue M to the left of the file vignettes/developer_vignette.Rmd indicates 
that this file has been modified on your hard disc. The files with the question
mark are files that are in the project directory but not part of the repository.
You now tick the file that you want to commit to the repository. In the above
screenshot the file vignettes/developer_vignette.Rmd has already been selected
and as a consequence, the lower half of the pop-up window shows the modifications
that have been made in the file. You should see your additions in green.

At the top right of the pop-up window you enter the commit message that will
allow you and others later to understand the purpose of this commit. It is
really useful to put a meaningful message here. The first time you make a commit
to a new branch, you may want to write an extended commit message that explains
what the new branch is for.

When you are happy with everything, hit the "Commit" button. Now your changes
are forever saved in the history of your local repository.

## Pushing and pulling

So far you have only committed your changes to the local repository on your
computer. The changes have not yet been synchronised with your repository on
GitHub. To do that, you click on the "Push" button on the toolbar of
the "Git" pane, the one that looks like an up arrow. A window will pop up that
will confirm if that push worked alright. You can then close that window.

It may be that you have several computers on which you work an you can have a
local repository on every one of them. In that scenario, it may be that you 
have pushed changes onto your GitHub repository from another computer. You will
then not be able to push your new changes from your current computer until you have
pulled those changes onto your current computer. You do that by hitting the
"Pull" button that looks like a down arrow right next to the "Push" button.
That will incorporate any changes from GitHub into your local repository and
this will generally go smoothly. Only in the case where you have edited the 
same lines of the same file on different machines can you run into conflicts
that git can not resolve automatically. In order to avoid such conflicts,
you should pull and push frequently.

After you have pushed your changes, you will be able to see them also on GitHub.
If you go to the home page of your GitHub repository you will see a comment
that you made a commit a little while ago.


## Making a pull request

Once a feature is developed and tested, you will want to merge it into the master
branch of the upstream repository at https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer. 
You can however not push your changes directly to that repository. Instead you
create a HitHub pull request. 
This will then get a code review from another mizer developer before one of the
developers with write access to the main repository merges your changes.

Due to this extra code review before any changes are integrated into the core
mizer code, you do not have to be hesitant with making pull requests. In case
there is anything wrong with your changes, you will get friendly feedback from
other developers. You can then make more changes and commit them to the same
branch and your pull request will automatically get updated.

The pull request is easy to create using the github web interface:

1. Go to the home page of your forked repository on Github
2. Select the branch via the "Branch" drop-down.
3. Click the "New pull request" button next to that drop-down.

Go ahead an create a pull request for your "add_my_info" branch.

Once your pull request has been reviewed and accepted by a developer and your
changes have thus been merged into the upstream master branch, you can
delete your development branch. There is a delete button on github to delete a
branch (for example on the page listing all your branches). You also need to
delete the branch separately in your local repository by issuing
```
git branch -d add_my_info
```
from the terminal, where `add_my_info' is the name of the development branch. 
In addition you may want to tell your local repository that the
remote branch has disappeared as well:
```
git remote prune origin
```
Otherwise it will stay in RStudio's list of remote branches.

## Merging from upstream

Once your pull request, or any pull request by anyone else with a mizer fork, has been merged into the upstream repository, the master
branch in your fork is no longer in sync with the upstream master branch.
So you will want to merge those upstream changes into our master branch.
To do that you can use the "Terminal" pane in RStudio, where you execute the
following git commands:
```
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
```
Again, unless you locally changed the same line in the same file that someone
else changed in the upstream repository, the merging will be automatic.
You should then push the merged master branch back to your GitHub repository
with the "Push" button.

If you get an error when attempting to fetch from upstream then the upstream
repository may not yet have been set for your repository. You can check with
```
git remote -v
```
If that does not list an upstream, then execute the command
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer.git
```
and then try the above again.

The first time you go through all the above steps, you will think that you will
never grow to like git. What a lot of fuss. What a circuitous route for your 
change to make it into the master branch of your GithHub repository:

1. from your editor to your harddrive
2. from your harddrive into your development branch in your local repository via Commit
3. from you local repository to your GitHub repository via Push
4. from your GitHub repository to the main mizer repository via Pull Request
5. from the main mizer repository to you local master branch via merge
6. from your local master branch to the master branch of your GitHub repository via Push

But this is the best system software developers have come up with to allow
many people to collaborate on the same code.

You may have more than one development branch because you may be working on
several features at the same time or some of your features are still waiting
to have their pull request merged. In that case,
after merging the upstream changes into our master branch, you may also want to
merge them from your master branch into some of your development branches. For
that you just go to the development branch and do
```
git merge master
```

# Contributor guidelines

## Coding style
[Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml)

[The tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/)

## Always write tests for your code
We use [testthat](http://testthat.r-lib.org/) and
[shinytest](https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest/articles/shinytest.html).
The test are in the directory `tests/testthat`. 

Some tests compare the results of calculations to the results the code gave in
the past, using the `testthat::expect_known_value()` test. The past values are stored in
tests/testthat/values. If one of the tests gives a value that is different from
the stored value, then the test throws an error *and* overwrites the stored
value with the new result. The second time the test is run, it then no longer
fails. Luckily the original values will still be in the git repository. So after
you think you have fixed the error that led to the wrong result, you should
revert to the old stored values before re-running the test. Reverting to the old
stored values is easy: Just go to the Git tab in RStudio, select the changed
files in `tests/testthat/values` (select, not tick), then right-click and choose
Revert.

When a plot has changed, the error message from `testthat::expect_known_value()`
is not particularly useful, because it compares two ggplot objects. In this 
case you should carefully compare the plots by eye. To view the old plot you 
have to first revert the file in `tests/testthat/values` and then load the plot
from that file with `readRDS("tests/testthat/values/name_of_plot_function")`.

It may be that the change in the result of a calculation is intended, perhaps
because your new code is more accurate than the old code. If you are 100%
certain of this, but only then, should you commit the changed files in
tests/testthat/values, so that these new values form the basis of future
comparison tests.


# Finding your way around the mizer code

This section is still in an early stage of development.

Mizer is organised in a modular fashion. It is separated into setup functions,
simulation functions, and analysis and plotting functions. 

There are several different functions for setting up a `MizerParams` object for
specifying various concrete models. These setup functions make various 
simplifying assumptions about the model parameters to reduce the amount of
information that needs to be specified. This usually takes the form of
assuming allometric scaling laws. 

The core of mizer is the `project()` function
that runs a simulation of the size-spectrum model. It takes a specification
of the model contained in an object of type `MizerParams` and returns the
results of the simulation in an object of type `MizerSim`.

There are many functions for analysing and plotting the results of a mizer
simulation contained in a `MizerSim` object.

The `MizerParams` and `MizerSim` objects are S4 objects,
meaning that their slots are rigorously defined and are accessed with the '@'
notation. You do not need to learn about S4 classes in order to understand the
mizer code, because the code avoids using S4 methods. In the presentation
below we assume that the `MizerParams` object is called `params` and the
`MixerSim` object is called `sim`.


## The MizerParams class
An object of class 'MizerParams' holds all the information needed for the
'project()' function to simulate a model. 

### Adding a new slot
If you need to add a new slot to the MizerParams class, you need to make the following additions in the file `MizerParams-class.R`:

1. Go to the section "Class definition" and add a
  description of you new slot with @slot.
2. Add an entry in the `slots` list inside `setClass`.
3. In the function `emptyParams()` go to the section "Make object" and inside
  the call to `new()` provide a default value for your slot. If your slot holds
  an array, then it is conventional in mizer to already give it the correct
  dimensions and dimnames here, if possible.

What exactly to put into these places is usually clear in analogy to what is
already there for other similar slots.

## Size of git repo
We should try to avoid committing too many very large files to the git
repository, because the larger the repository the longer it takes to download.
Currently (September 2019) the repository is still at a manageable 110 MiB.
The best way to check the size of the repository is with the git-sizer, see
https://github.com/github/git-sizer/

We are currently storing the mizer website in the mizer repository (in the docs
subdirectory). That is convenient, partly because that is where pkgdown puts it
by default and GitHub serves it from there. However in the future we might
consider moving the website to its own repository.


## People with a mizer fork
