# Introduction

This vignette is for you if you need to extend mizer 
to meet the needs of your research project.
You will already have read the mizer model description in
`vignette("model_description")`
and thus be familiar with what mizer can do out of the box.
You now want to implement the extension or modification of the
model required for your research, and for that you need to dive into 
the internal workings of mizer. This vignette is meant to make
that as easy as possible.

The first thing you should do, even before reading this vignette, is to
go to https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer/issues and create a new "issue""
to share your ideas and plans with the mizer community. You may get back 
valuable feedback and advice. Another way to get in touch with the
mizer community is via the [size-spectrum modelling Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/size-spectrum-models).


# Setting up working environment
In this section we describe how to set up your working environment
to allow you to easily work with the mizer code. Much of it you
may already have in place, so feel free to skip ahead.

## Installing R, RStudio, devtools

Mizer is compatible with R versions 3.1 and later.
If you still need to [install R](https://cran.r-project.org/), simply install 
the latest version. This vignette was prepared with
`r R.version.string`.

This guide assumes that you will be using RStudio to work with R. There is
really no reason not to use RStudio and it makes a lot of things much easier.
RStudio develops rapidly and adds useful features all the time and so it pays 
to upgrade to the [latest version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) 
frequently. This guide was written with version 1.2.1268.

To work with R packages as a developer, you will need to
[install additional tools](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486498-Package-Development-Prerequisites). Once you have these in place, you should install the devtools package with
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```
You are now all set to develop R packages, and 
[RStudio makes this extra easy](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486488-Developing-Packages-with-RStudio). There is even a cheat sheet for package development accessible from the Help menu in RStudio.



## Installing Git
Mizer is developed using the version control system _Git_ and the code is hosted
on GitHub. To contribute to the mizer code, you need to have the Git software
installed on your system. On most Linux machines it will be installed already,
but otherwise you need to
[install it](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html). You do not need to install
any GUI for git because RStudio has 
[built-in support for git](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN). 
A good place to learn about using Git and GitHub is 
[this chapter](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html) 
in the guide by Hadley on R package development.

## Forking mizer from GitHub

To work with the code you will create your own git repository with a copy of the mizer code. Go to https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer and fork it into your own repository by clicking the "Fork" button.

<center>
![](images/fork.png){width=80%}
</center>

You will be prompted to log in to GitHub. If you do not yet have an account, 
you need to create one for yourself.

Once you have your own fork of the mizer repository, you create a local copy on
whichever machine you work on. You can do this from within RStudio. For this you
click on the "Project" drop-down and then select "New Project...".

<center>
![](images/new_project.png){width=80%}
</center>

This will bring up a dialog box where you select "Version Control".
<center>
![](images/version_control.png){width=50%}
</center>

Provided you have Git installed and RStudio was able to find it you can then
choose "Git" on the next dialog box.

<center>
![](images/git.png){width=50%}
</center>

If the Git option is not showing, the you need to troubleshoot, and perhaps
https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-see-git.html helps.

In the next dialog box you let RStudio know where to find your fork.
<center>
![](images/repository.png){width=50%}
</center>

To find the correct repository URL you go back to GitHub to the front page of 
the repository that was created when you forked the official mizer repository.
There you will find a "Clone or download" button which when clicked will
reveal the repository URL. Make sure that you are on the page of your fork of
the repository. The URL should contain your GitHub username.
<center>
![](images/repro_url.png){width=80%}
</center>

You can copy that to the clipboard by pressing the
button next to the URL and then paste it back into the RStudio dialog box.
In that dialog box you can also change where RStudio stores the repository on
your machine. Choose anywhere convenient. Then click "Create Project".


## Setting up RStudio developer tools
You will want to set up RStudio so that it automatically builds the 
documentation using roxygen.
* Go to Build -> Configure Build Tools, tick the checkbox "Generate
  documentation with roxygen".


To run this code go to the "Build" tab in RStudio and click on "Install and Restart". 
This builds and loads the mizer package based on this development code.

# Finding your way around the mizer code

Mizer is organised in a modular fashion. It is separated into setup functions,
simulation functions, and analysis and plotting functions. These will
be described below after we have introduced the mizer model.

The core of mizer is the `project()` function
that runs a simulation of the size-spectrum model. It takes a specification
of the model contained in an object of type `MizerParams` and returns the
results of the simulation in an object of type `MizerSim`.

There are several different functions for setting up a `MizerParams` object for
specifying various concrete models. These setup functions make various 
simplifying assumptions about the model parameters to reduce the amount of
information that needs to be specified. This usually takes the form of
assuming allometric scaling laws. Below we will first describe the most
general size spectrum model handled by mizer before describing the
specialisations for which mizer has special setup functions.

There are many functions for analysing and plotting the results of a mizer
simulation contained in a `MizerSim` object.

The `MizerParams` and `MizerSim` objects are S4 objects,
meaning that their slots are rigorously defined and are accessed with the '@'
notation. You do not need to learn about S4 classes in order to understand the
mizer code, because the code avoids using S4 methods. In the presentation
below we assume that the `MizerParams` object is called `params` and the
`MixerSim` object is called `sim`.


## The MizerParams class
An object of class 'MizerParams' holds all the information needed for the
'project()' function to simulate a model. 

### Adding a new slot
If you need to add a new slot to the MizerParams class, you need to make the following additions in the file `MizerParams-class.R`:

1. Go to the section "Class definition" and add a
  description of you new slot with @slot.
2. Add an entry in the `slots` list inside `setClass`.
3. In the function `emptyParams()` go to the section "Make object" and inside
  the call to `new()` provide a default value for your slot. If your slot holds
  an array, then it is conventional in mizer to already give it the correct
  dimensions and dimnames here, if possible.

What exactly to put into these places is usually clear in analogy to what is
already there for other similar slots.

[The tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/)

## Always write tests for your code
We use [testthat](http://testthat.r-lib.org/) and
[shinytest](https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest/articles/shinytest.html).
The test are in the directory `tests/testthat`. 

Some tests compare the results of calculations to the results the code gave in
the past, using the `testthat::expect_known_value()` test. The past values are stored in
tests/testthat/values. If one of the tests gives a value that is different from
the stored value, then the test throws an error *and* overwrites the stored
value with the new result. The second time the test is run, it then no longer
fails. Luckily the original values will still be in the git repository. So after
you think you have fixed the error that led to the wrong result, you should
revert to the old stored values before re-running the test. Reverting to the old
stored values is easy: Just go to the Git tab in RStudio, select the changed
files in `tests/testthat/values` (select, not tick), then right-click and choose
Revert.

When a plot has changed, the error message from `testthat::expect_known_value()`
is not particularly useful, because it compares two ggplot objects. In this 
case you should carefully compare the plots by eye. To view the old plot you 
have to first revert the file in `tests/testthat/values` and then load the plot
from that file with `readRDS("tests/testthat/values/name_of_plot_function")`.

It may be that the change in the result of a calculation is intended, perhaps
because your new code is more accurate than the old code. If you are 100%
certain of this, but only then, should you commit the changed files in
tests/testthat/values, so that these new values form the basis of future
comparison tests.


## Rebuild package after altering code
If you make a change to mizer's code you will have to rebuild the package after 
you are done. In RStudio this can be done by clicking on the *Build* tab at the 
top right and clicking *Install and Restart*. To be sure that the changes have 
taken proper effect it may also help to clean the environment and/or restart 
RStudio.

To be sure that the package
builds properly, make sure that the Roxygen2 package is properly installed, and 
click the *More* dropdown, on the *Build* tab, and click *Configure Build Tools*
and tick *Use devtools package functions if available* and
*Generate documentation with Roxygen*, and click *Configure* and under
*Automatically roxygenize when running:* tick *Build & Reload*.
