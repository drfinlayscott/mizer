\title{Upgrade MizerParams object from earlier mizer versions}
\usage{
upgradeParams(params)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{An old MizerParams object to be upgraded}
}
\value{
The upgraded MizerParams object
}
\description{
Occasionally during the development of new features for mizer, the
MizerParams object gains extra slots. MizerParams objects created in older
versions of mizer are then no longer valid in the new version because of
the missing slots. This function adds the missing slots and fills them
with default values.
}
\details{
Uses set_multispecies_model() to create a new MizerParams object using the
parameters extracted from the old MizerParams object.

If you only have a serialised version of the old object, for example
created via `saveRDS()`, and you get an error when trying to read it in
with `readRDS()` then unfortunately you will need to install the old version
of mizer first to read the params object into your workspace, then switch
to the current version and then call `upgradeParams()`. You can then save
the new version again with `saveRDS()`.
