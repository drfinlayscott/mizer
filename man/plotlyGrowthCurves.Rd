\title{Plot growth curves giving weight as a function of age with plotly}
\usage{
plotlyGrowthCurves(object, species, max_age = 20, percentage = FALSE,
  print_it = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{MizerSim or MizerParams object}

\item{species}{Name or vector of names of the species to be included. By
default all species are included.}

\item{max_age}{The age up to which to run the growth curve. Default is 20.}

\item{percentage}{Boolean value. If TRUE, the size is given as a percentage
of the maximal size.}

\item{print_it}{Display the plot, or just return the ggplot2 object.
Defaults to FALSE}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
If given a \linkS4class{MizerSim} object, uses the growth rates at the final
time of a simulation to calculate the size at age. If given a
\linkS4class{MizerParams} object, uses the initial growth rates instead.
}
\details{
When the growth curve for only a single species is plotted, horizontal
lines are included that indicate the maturity size and the maximum size for 
that species. If furthermore the species parameters contain the variables
a and b for length to weight conversion and the von Bertalanffy parameter
k_vb, then the von Bertalanffy growth curve is superimposed in black.
