\title{Get energy rate available for growth}
\usage{
getEGrowth(object, n = object@initial_n, n_pp = object@initial_n_pp,
  B = object@initial_B, e_repro = getERepro(object, n = n, n_pp = n_pp,
  B = B), e = getEReproAndGrowth(object, n = n, n_pp = n_pp, B = B))
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \linkS4class{MizerParams} object}

\item{n}{A matrix of species abundances (species x size)}

\item{n_pp}{A vector of the plankton abundance by size}

\item{B}{A vector of biomasses of unstructured resource components}

\item{e_repro}{The energy available for reproduction (optional, although if
specified, e must also be specified). A matrix of size no. species x no.
size bins. If not supplied, is calculated internally using
\code{\link{getERepro}}.}

\item{e}{The energy available for reproduction and growth (optional, although
if specified, e_repro must also be specified). A matrix of size no.
species x no. size bins. If not supplied, is calculated internally using
\code{\link{getEReproAndGrowth}}.}
}
\value{
A two dimensional array (prey species x prey size)
}
\description{
Calculates the energy rate \eqn{g_i(w)} (grams/year) available by species and
size for growth after metabolism, movement and reproduction have been
accounted for. Used by \code{\link{project}} for performing simulations.

# Project with constant fishing effort for all gears for 20 time steps
