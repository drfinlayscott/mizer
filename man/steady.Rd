\title{Tune params object to be at steady state}
\usage{
steady(params, effort = 0, t_max = 50, t_per = 2, tol = 10^(-2),
  shiny_progress = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A \linkS4class{MizerParams} object}

\item{effort}{The fishing effort. Default is 0}

\item{t_max}{The maximum number of years to run the simulation. Default is 50.}

\item{t_per}{The simulation is broken up into shorter runs of t_per years,
after each of which we check for convergence. Default value is 2.}

\item{tol}{The simulation stops when the relative change in the egg
production RDI over a t_per is less than rel_tol for every background
species. Default value is 1/100.}
}
\description{
This is done by running the dynamics for a specified number of years
while keeping recruitment constant to reach steady state. Then
the reproductive efficiencies are retuned to achieve that level of
recruitment.
