\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{w}}{The size grid for the fish part of the spectrum. An increasing
vector of weights (in grams) running from the smallest egg size to the
largest asymptotic size.}

\item{\code{dw}}{The spacing in the size grid. So dw[i] = w[i+1] - w[i]. A vector 
the same length as the w_full slot. The last entry is not determined by
the w slot but represents the size of the last size bin.}

\item{\code{w_full}}{The size grid for the full size range including the plankton
spectrum. An increasing vector of weights (in grams) running from the
smallest plankton size to the largest asymptotic size of fish. The
last entries of the vector have to be equal to the content of the w slot.}

\item{\code{dw_full}}{The spacing in the full size grid. 
So dw_full[i] = w_full[i+1] - w_full[i]. The last entries have to be
equal to the content of the dw slot.}

\item{\code{w_min_idx}}{A vector holding the index of the weight of the egg size
of each species}

\item{\code{maturity}}{An array (species x size) that holds the proportion of
individuals of each species at size that are mature. This enters in the
calculation of the spawning stock biomass with \code{\link{getSSB}}. Set 
with \code{\link{setReproduction}}.}

\item{\code{psi}}{An array (species x size) that holds the allocation to reproduction
for each species at size, \eqn{\psi_i(w)}. Changed with 
\code{\link{setReproduction}}.}

each species at size. Changed with \code{\link{setIntakeMax}}.}

each species at size. Changed with \code{\link{setSearchVolume}}.}

\item{\code{rho}}{A 3-dim array (species x resource x size) holding the encounter
rates for unstructured resources. Changed with 
\code{\link{setResourceEncounter}}.}

\eqn{\mu_{b.i}(w)}. Changed with \code{\link{setBMort}}.}

\item{\code{pred_kernel}}{An array (species x predator size x prey size) that holds
the predation coefficient of each predator at size on each prey size. If
this is NA then the following two slots will be used. Changed with 
\code{\link{setPredKernel}}.}

\item{\code{ft_pred_kernel_e}}{An array (species x log of predator/prey size ratio)
that holds the Fourier transform of the feeding kernel in a form
appropriate for evaluating the encounter rate integral. If this is NA
then the \code{pred_kernel} will be used to calculate the available 
energy integral. Changed with \code{\link{setPredKernel}}.}

\item{\code{ft_pred_kernel_p}}{An array (species x log of predator/prey size ratio)
that holds the Fourier transform of the feeding kernel in a form
appropriate for evaluating the predation mortality integral. If this is NA
then the \code{pred_kernel} will be used to calculate the integral.

growth rate of the plankton spectrum. Changed with \code{\link{setPlankton}}.}

carrying capacity of the plankton spectrum. Changed with

density by one timestep. The default is 
\code{\link{plankton_semichemostat}}.

\note{
The \linkS4class{MizerParams} class is fairly complex with a large number of
  slots, many of which are multidimensional arrays. The dimensions of these
  arrays is strictly enforced so that \code{MizerParams} objects are
  consistent in terms of number of species and number of size classes.
  
  Although it is possible to build a \code{MizerParams} object by hand it is
  not recommended and several constructors are available.
  
  The \code{MizerParams} class does not hold any dynamic information, e.g.
  abundances or harvest effort through time. These are held in
  \linkS4class{MizerSim} objects.
