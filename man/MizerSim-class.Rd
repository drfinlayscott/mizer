\title{A class to hold the results of a simulation}
\description{
A class that holds the results of projecting a \linkS4class{MizerParams}
object through time.
}
\details{
\linkS4class{MizerSim} objects are created by using the \code{\link{project}} method
on an object of type \code{MizerParams}.

There are several plotting methods available to explore the contents of a
\code{MizerSim} object. See the package vignette for more details.
