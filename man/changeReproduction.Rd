Sets the proportion of the total energy available for reproduction and growth

individual and sets the reproductive efficiency.

\section{Setting reproduction}{

For each species and at each size, the proportion of the available energy 
that is invested into reproduction is the product of two factors: the
proportion \code{maturity} of individuals that are mature and the proportion
\code{repro_prop} of the energy available to a mature individual that is 
invested into reproduction.

If the \code{maturity} argument is not supplied, then it is set to a sigmoidal 
maturity ogive that changes from 0 to 1 at around the maturity size:
\deqn{{\tt maturity}(w) = \left[1+\left(\frac{w}{w_{mat}}\right)^{-U}\right]^{-1}.}{
  maturity(w) = [1+(w/w_mat)^(-U)]^(-1)}
(To avoid clutter, we are not showing the species index in the equations.)
The maturity weights are taken from the \code{w_mat} column of the 
species_params data frame. Any missing maturity weights are set to 1/4 of the
asymptotic weight in the \code{w_inf} column.
The exponent \eqn{U} determines the steepness of the maturity ogive. By
default it is chosen as \eqn{U = 10}, however this can be overridden by
including a column \code{w_mat25} in the species parameter dataframe that
specifies the weight at which 25\% of individuals are mature, which sets
\eqn{U = \log(3) / \log(w_{mat} / w_{25}).}{U = log(3) / log(w_mat / w_25).}

The sigmoidal function given above would strictly reach 1 only asymptotically.
Mizer instead sets the function equal to 1 already at the species' 
maximum size, taken from the compulsory \code{w_inf} column in the
\code{species_params} data frame.

If the \code{repro_prop} argument is not supplied, it is set to the
allometric form
\deqn{{\tt repro\_prop}(w) = \left(\frac{w}{w_{inf}}\right)^{m-n}.}{
  repro_prop = (w/w_inf)^(m - n).}
Here \eqn{n} is the scaling exponent of the energy income rate. Hence
the exponent \eqn{m} determines the scaling of the investment into
reproduction for mature individuals. By default it is chosen to be 
\eqn{m = 1} so that the rate at which energy is invested into reproduction 
scales linearly with the size. This default can be overridden by including a 
column \code{m} in the species parameter dataframe. The asymptotic sizes
are taken from the compulsory \code{w_inf} column in the species_params
data frame.

The reproductive efficiency, i.e., the proportion of energy allocated to
reproduction that results in offspring biomass, is set from the 
\code{erepro} column in the species_params data frame. If that is not
provided the default is set to 1 (which you will want to override).
