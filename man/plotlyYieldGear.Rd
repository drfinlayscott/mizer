\title{Plot the total yield of each species by gear through time with plotly}
\usage{
plotlyYieldGear(sim, species = dimnames(sim@n)$sp, print_it = FALSE,
  total = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim}{An object of class \linkS4class{MizerSim}}

\item{species}{Name or vector of names of the species to be plotted. By
default all species are plotted.}

\item{print_it}{Display the plot, or just return the ggplot2 object. 
Defaults to FALSE}

\item{total}{A boolean value that determines whether the total yield
per gear over all species in the system is plotted as well. Default is FALSE}

\item{...}{Other arguments to pass to \code{\link{getYieldGear}} method}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
After running a projection, the total yield of each species by fishing gear
can be plotted against time.
}
\details{
This plot is pretty easy to do by hand. It just
gets the biomass using the \code{\link{getYieldGear}} method and plots using
the ggplot2 package. You can then fiddle about with colours and linetypes
etc. Just look at the source code for details.
