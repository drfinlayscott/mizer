\title{Retunes abundance multipliers of background species so aggregate abundance is
a power law.}
\usage{
retune_abundance(params)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A mizer params object with an A slot with 1's for species we
wish to hold fixed the abundance multiplier of, and NA's for species that
we shall vary the abundance multiplier of.}
}
\value{
An object of type \code{MizerParams}
}
\description{
If N_i(w) is a steady state of the McKendrik-von Foerster (MVF) equation with
fixed growth and death rates, then A_i*N_i(w) is also a steady state, where
A_i is an abundance multiplier. When we add a foreground species to our
model, we want to choose new abundance multipliers of the background species
so that we the abundance, summed over all species and background resources,
is close to sc(w), which is the aggregate abundance of all but the last
species. We are assuming this last species is newly added, with A_i=1.
}
\details{
retune_abundance operates of a params object, with a slot A. If i is a
background species, then A_i=NA, indicating we are allowed to retune the
abundance multiplier.
