\usage{
changeMetab(params, metab = NULL, p = params@p)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{MizerParams}

\item{metab}{Optional. An array (species x size) holding the metabolic rate
for each species at size. If not supplied, a default is set as described in
the section "Setting metabolic rate".}

\item{p}{Scaling exponent of the standard metabolic rate.}
}
\value{
MizerParams
}
\description{
Sets the rate at which energy is used for metabolism and activity
}
\section{Setting metabolic rate}{

The metabolic rate is subtracted from the energy income rate to calculate
the rate at which energy is available for growth and reproduction, see
\code{\link{getEReproAndGrowth}}.

If the \code{metab} argument is not supplied, then the metabolic
rate \eqn{k_i(w)} for and individual of species \eqn{i} and size \eqn{w}
is set to \deqn{k_i(w) = ks_i\, w^p + k_i\, w,}{k_i(w) = ks_i w^p + k_i w}
where \eqn{ks_i w^p} represents the rate of standard metabolism and 
\eqn{k_i w} is the rate at which energy is expended on activity and movement.
The values of \eqn{ks_i} and \eqn{k_i} are taken from the \code{ks} and
\code{k} columns in the
species parameter dataframe. If these parameters are not supplied, the
defaults are \eqn{ks_i = 0.2 h_i} and \eqn{k_i = 0} where \eqn{h_i} is the
coefficient of the maximum intake rate.
