\title{Add new species}
\usage{
addSpecies(params, species_params, interaction)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A mizer params object for the original system.}

\item{species_params}{The species parameters of the new species we
want to add to the system.}

\item{interaction}{Interaction matrix. A square matrix giving either the
interaction coefficients between all species or only those between the
new species. In the latter case all interaction between an old and a new
species are set to 1. If this argument is missing, all interactions 
involving a new species are set to 1.}
}
\value{
An object of type \linkS4class{MizerParams}
}
\description{
Takes a \linkS4class{MizerParams} object and adds additional species with
given parameters to the ecosystem. It sets the initial values for these new
species to its steady-state solution in the given initial state of the
existing ecosystem. This will be close to the true steady-state if the
abundances of the new species are sufficiently low. Hence the abundances of
the new species are set so that the maximal biomass density of each new
species lies at 1/100 of the community power law. The reproductive
efficiencies of the new species are set so as to keep them at that low level.
}
\details{
After adding the new species, the background species are not retuned and the
system is not run to steady state. You would have to call
\code{\link{retuneBackground}} and \code{\link{steady}} explicitly.
